# SWE Department Course ITSE322 Advance Programming in Java

Welcome to the SWE Department course content repository! This repo is designed to make it easier for students to access course materials and code. However, to truly understand the syllabus, it's essential to attend lectures and write each line of code yourself. If you encounter parts of the code that you don't understand, make sure to Google them to learn why they exist.

Afterward, experiment with the codeâ€”try to improve it, overengineer it, or rewrite it using better or newer functions. This hands-on approach is crucial because simply reading the code can give you the illusion that you've studied it and are prepared for exams, but you might not be. Please take the advice in this README seriously.
