This repo is created to ease the reach to the cousre content and codes for the students of SWE Dept, however to better learn the syllabus make sure to attend lectures and write each code of line
by yourself, then google the parts of the code that you don't understand its reason to exist there
finally tinker with the code and try to improve it, overengineer it, or maybe rewrite it with better/newer functuions
this advice is given based on the fact that reading the code lines gives you the illusino that you have studied it and is prepared for the exam
yet you aren't, and hope you take the advices in this Readme file srsly.


for any colaboration requests, make a fork, push to your branche the new content, mssg me on Tele @LibyaChmapion regarding the pull request, 
main branch will be updated if your additions have value or improvments to the existing lectures or code files.


GLHF and don't lose your sanity amidst your ambitions and doubts,
hardworkers will always prevail thier anexiety, fears and stumbles
